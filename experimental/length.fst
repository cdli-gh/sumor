% in syllabic scripts, vowels or consonants at sign boundaries can be written redundantly (plene writing)
% on the other hand, plene writing for expressing length is not systematically applied (i.e., it is not clear whether it is actually used for writing length distinctions)

% in this transducer, we 
% - take in a transcription without morpheme boundaries
% - we eliminate repeated "phonemes"
% - we create alternations:
%   CVC => CVVC, VCV => VCCV
% it's a bit hard to control
